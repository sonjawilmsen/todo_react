This project is a to do app based on a ruby on rails API and React Front end. This repository is the React frond end which uses the API from the following repo: https://github.com/sonjawilmsen/todoweek5. 

It is a work in progress. I made this app based on some examples from earlier work during the Codaisseur program. It is helping me understand the workings of React, but it can use some tweeking.
